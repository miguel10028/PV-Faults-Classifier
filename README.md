# Infrared-Solar-Modules-Classifier
Evaluation of different Machine learning models to classify thermal images from PV panels.



## Data 
Taken from --> https://github.com/RaptorMaps/InfraredSolarModules

- 20,000 infrared images that are 24 by 40 pixels each
- 12 classes (11 classes of and one cclass being No-Anomaly)

|Class Name|	Images|	Description|
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Cell	 | 1,877|	Hot spot occurring with square geometry in single cell.|
|Cell-Multi	| 1,288|	Hot spots occurring with square geometry in multiple cells.|
|Cracking|	941|	Module anomaly caused by cracking on module surface.|
|Hot-Spot|	251|	Hot spot on a thin film module.|
|Hot-Spot-Multi|	247|	Multiple hot spots on a thin film module.|
|Shadowing|	1056|	Sunlight obstructed by vegetation, man-made structures, or adjacent rows.|
|Diode|	1,499|	Activated bypass diode, typically 1/3 of module.|
|Diode-Multi|	175|	Multiple activated bypass diodes, typically affecting 2/3 of module.|
|Vegetation|	1,639|	Panels blocked by vegetation.|
|Soiling|	205|	Dirt, dust, or other debris on surface of module.|
|Offline-Module|	828|	Entire module is heated.|
|No-Anomaly|	10,000|	Nominal solar module.|
